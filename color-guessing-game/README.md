### Goals/Outcomes

1. Initial Display:
    * As a user, I want to see a box displaying a random color when the page loads.
    * As a user, I want to see three buttons below the color box, each with a different hex code.

2. Randomization of Colors and Hex Codes:
    * As a user, I want the color in the box to be randomly generated on each page load.
    * As a user, I want the hex codes on the buttons to be randomly assigned on each page load, with one button having the correct hex code and the other two having random wrong hex codes.

3. Identifying the Correct Button:
    * As a user, I should know that one of the three buttons corresponds to the hex code of the color displayed in the box.

4. Displaying Correct and Wrong Feedback:
    * As a user, I want to click a button and receive feedback based on whether it's the correct or wrong answer.
    * As a user, I want to see the text "Correct!" displayed below the buttons when I click the correct button.
    * As a user, I want to see the text "Wrong Answer!" displayed below the buttons when I click the wrong button.

5. Changing Color and Buttons on Correct Answer:
    * As a user, I want the color in the box to change when I click the correct button.
    * As a user, I want the hex codes on the buttons to change, with one button having the correct hex code and the other two having random wrong hex codes.

6. Validation for Empty Input:
    * As a user, I should not be able to add an empty string to the "todo" list.
