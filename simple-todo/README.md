### Goals/Outcomes

1. Adding a Todo:
    * As a user, I want to see an input bar where I can type a new todo item.
    * As a user, I want to submit the input to add a new todo to the "todo" list.

2. Completing a Todo:
    * As a user, I want to see a list of todo items.
    * As a user, I want to be able to click a checkbox next to a todo item to mark it as completed.
    * As a user, I want the completed todo item to move to the "completed" list with a checked checkbox and a strikethrough on the text.

3. Undoing a Completion:
    * As a user, I want to be able to click the checkbox next to a completed item to mark it as todo.
    * As a user, I want the todo item to move back to the "todo" list without a checked checkbox and without a strikethrough.

4. Displaying Completion Status:
    * As a user, I want to see a message indicating "Nice work, you've completed all todos!" when there are no remaining todos in the "todo" list.
    * As a user, I want to see a message indicating "No completed todos" when there are no items in the "completed" list.

5. Visual Indicators:
    * As a user, I want a visual indicator (e.g., strikethrough) to show that an item in the "completed" list has been completed.
    * As a user, I want a visual indicator (e.g., checked checkbox) to show that an item in the "completed" list has been completed.

6. Validation for Empty Input:
    * As a user, I should not be able to add an empty string to the "todo" list.
